# Assignment 1 (Database design and EER modeling)
Your report must contain the following three files:

* `EER.pdf` - A PDF file with a picture of the EER diagram (task 1).
* `Assumptions.txt` or `Assumptions.pdf` - A text file (or a PDF file) with notes regarding the additional choices and assumptions you have made when creating your EER diagram.
* `RM.pdf` - A PDF file with a picture of the diagram that presents your relational database schema (task 2).

Place these files into this gitlab folder. Additionally, this folder may also contain any source files that you have used to create the aforementioned PDFs (e.g., files from the program in which you have drawn the diagrams). However, you may also draw the diagrams offline on a sheet of paper, in which case your PDF files should be photocopies or (high resolution) photos of the papers.

## Drawing diagrams
This folder also contains an initial `template.drawio` file with examples of EER and RM diagrams. You may use this file as a template if you want to draw your diagrams using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io). To this end, you may go through the following steps.

1. Download the `template.drawio` file
2. Open it using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io)
3. Follow the instructions from the template and implement the assignment
4. Save the `template.drawio` and export the final diagrams as the aforementioned two PDF files
5. Place the files in this folder
5. Submit as described in the [README](https://gitlab.liu.se/olaha93/db/-/blob/master/README.md)
