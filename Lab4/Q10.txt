c)
ANSWER: I got an error when I ran the query on multiple sessions because of primary key voilation. Given below:
CALL addPayment(@a, "Sauron",7878787878)	Error Code: 1062. Duplicate entry '7878787878' for key 'b_creditcard.PRIMARY'

d)
ANSWER: By adding START TRANSACTION and COMMIT we can avoid overbooking. Also using LOCK TABLES we can lock the table when payment is under progress so system can't add more bookings.
e.g:
START TRANSACTION
.....
CALL addPayment(@a, "Sauron",7878787878);
.....
COMMIT
