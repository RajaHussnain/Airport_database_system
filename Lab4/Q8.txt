8. Answer the following theoretical questions:
a) How can you protect the credit card information in the database from hackers?
ANSWER: To protect the credit card information in the database encryption can be used which is provided by mySQL or we can also store the credit card number into 2 or 3 different tables by breaking it and storing it in more scure table with limited-access password protected dirtectory.

b) Give three advantages of using stored procedures in the database (and thereby execute them on the server) instead of writing the same functions in the front-end of the system (in for example java-script on a web-page)?
ANSWER: 1: Reduce the network traffic between application and mysql server.
		2: Reduce the duplication effort, if different applications need similar computation store procedures help with single unified program.
		3: Performing calculation in the front-end of the system is not secure hence using stored procedure is more secure approach.
